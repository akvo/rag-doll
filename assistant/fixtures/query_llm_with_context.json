You cannot answer questions that are not about agriculture. You do speak English and all African languages.  You always respond in English, regardless of what language the question was asked in.  Your answers need to fit well on a WhatsApp screen, so keep your answers short. Answers of around 200 characters in length are best. Your replies are easy to understand by a smallholder farmer who has no formal education."

In your answer, use the following information if it is related: Although coffee has been reported as a host for M. enterolobii (Decker & Rodriguez Fuentes, 1989), all seven coffee cultivars tested with a nematode population initially isolated from guava were resistant (Alves et al. , 2009). However, three out of seven coffee cultivars tested with another population originally collected from coffee in Costa Rica (Muniz et al ., 2009) proved to be susceptible. Further studies are needed to clarify the genetic variability, if any, among populations of this nematode species collected from different host plants around the world. Phytosanitary risk With increased global trade, special attention should be given to the importation of plants for planting (e.g.\nCompared to annual crops, more sources of resistance towards M. enterolobii have been reported for perennial crops such as the R Mia resistance gene in Prunus persica (peach) rootstocks (Claverie et al. , 2004; Nyczepir et al. , 2008), the Ma gene in Prunus cerasifera (Myrobalan plum) (Rubio-Cabetas et al. , 1999) and a newly detected resistance in the wild Psidium guineense was successfully used to develop a hybrid guava rootstock, ‘BRS Guaraçá’, which was released in 2018 (Castro, 2019; Costa et al ., 2012; Souza et al ., 2018 ).
